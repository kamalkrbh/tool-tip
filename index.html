<h3>{{ "How to test GitLab CI locally." }}</h3>
<p>This is common use case where a developer wants to test his changes against a GitLab pipe-line without pushing changes to repository so that any potential failure does not bother everybody else in the team.

GitLab Runner can be used to test the CI pipeline defined in gitlab-ct.yml locally.
</p>
Can be done in following simple steps :

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Install gitlab-runner</b>, For Debian/Ubuntu/Mint do it as follows :
        curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
        sudo apt-get install gitlab-runner
        My gitlab-runner version is 12.4.1
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Register gitlab-runner </b> with GitLab server: Not Needed
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Test GitLab CI</b>
        Go to the directory where .gitlab-ci.yml file is kept, then :
        To run specific stage just give name of the stage at the end gitlab-runner exec docker build docker is the name
        of executor here.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Drawbacks :</h4>
As of gitlab-runner version 12.4.1 exec can only run one job not full pipeline.
Local code changes can not be tested as gitlab-runner always fetches latest code from GitLab server although there are feature proposals in progress: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/1359  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/2797
